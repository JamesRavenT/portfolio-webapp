    desc: `"Hello, world!" — this simple phrase marked the start of my coding journey back in junior high. 
            Inspired by a lesson on Web Development, I grew deeply fascinated with how things work behind the screen, eventually leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. \n
            Though my first role led me into the customer service industry, my passion for tech never faded. I also believe the best developers are great listeners — and I’ve been both. \n
            Now, I'm focused on pursuing what I've always loved: crafting clean, efficient code and solving real-world problems through technology. My long-term goal? To build my own Jarvis.`,
