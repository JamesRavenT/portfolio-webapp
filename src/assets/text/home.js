AboutMe.txt = `With a foundation in Computer Science and hands-on experience in customer service,  
                I bring both technical skills and a deep understanding of people into my work.  
                My journey may have started in support, but my passion has always pointed toward software.  
                Now, I'm focused on building thoughtful, user-centered solutions â€” one line of code at a time.`
