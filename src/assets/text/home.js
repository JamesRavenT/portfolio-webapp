  desc: `"My career began outside of software development, 
            but my drive to solve problems and create meaningful solutions led me to teaching myself web development. 
            Through personal projects, I’ve built skills in turning ideas into working applications, always guided by persistence and curiosity.

           Coming from a customer-facing background, 
           I bring adaptability, empathy, and strong communication skills—qualities that help me understand users and collaborate effectively with teams. 
           While I may not yet have formal industry experience, I’m eager to grow as a developer, contribute to impactful projects, and continuously sharpen my craft.`,
